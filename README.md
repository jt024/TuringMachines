# TuringMachines
For this assignment you will change your program for FSM to be a Turing machine. 

It appears that the reading the transition functions from a file (added to eliminate confusion) has caused confusion.  So rather than used the file, you should prompt me for the transition functions.  You can ask how many states there are, and how many symbols there are.  We will use the universal turing machine convention where we always start in state 1 and state 2 is the final accepting state.  If this is unclear, come and see me during my office hours or by an appointment.
